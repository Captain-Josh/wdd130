            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Whitewater Rafting Company was founded by a team of river sport enthusiasts who
                wanted to make whitewater adventure accessible to both beginners and thrill seekers.

                a single stretch of river, the company quickly grew as its reputation for safety,
                skilled guides,and unforgettable river experiences spread. Over the years, it
                expanded its routes, upgraded equipment, and introduced multi day expedition
                packages, all while promoting environmental stewardship and responsible tourism.
                Today, Whitewater Rafting Company is recognized as a trusted leader in adventure
                travel, offering diverse rafting experiences that combine excitement, nature, and
