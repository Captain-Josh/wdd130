        <h1>NWEKE JOSHUA | WDD 130</h1>
        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, My name is Joshua Nweke" width="200">
        <p>Hello, my name is Nweke Joshua, though most of my friends prefer to call me Captain Josh.
            The
            nickname came naturally over the years because of my deep admiration for the military,
            the discipline, the courage, the strategy, and the sense of purpose that soldiers carry
            with them. Even though I am not in the military myself, I have always found inspiration
            in their values. Whenever people see how passionately I talk about military life,
            leadership, and resilience, they instantly understand why the name “Captain Josh” fits
            me perfectly. Nigeria is a place that shapes you in many ways, our environment teaches
            you adaptability, creativity, and the ability to thrive even in challenging
            circumstances. These are qualities I have carried into every part of my life, including
            my journey into web development.
            Speaking of web development, I am relatively new to this field, but the experience so
            far has been incredibly exciting. always knew that technology was powerful, but it hits
            differently when you begin learning how to build things with your own hands, things
            people can interact with, use, and benefit from. It gives you a sense of empowerment and
            creativity that is hard to describe. During the first week, I have been introduced to
            the basics, the foundational concepts that every developer must understand. I have
            worked
            with simple HTML structures, explored basic CSS styling, and learned how these two
            languages work together to create the visual and structural elements of a webpage. I am
            also grateful for the structure of this course. The lessons are clear, practical, and
            hands on, which helps me understand not just what to do, but why things work the way
            they do. Seeing my work come alive on the screen through Live Server browser refreshes
            gives me a feeling of accomplishment that pushes me to keep going. </p>
